### About
This code are extracted examples from free Udacity course on Tensorflow. 

#### 1_celsius-fahrenheit.py
This is simple regression example. Model gets two sequences of numbers and tries to find rule, thanks to which it can make predictions.
Model has one neuron, because transformation Celsius to Fahrenheit is linear function: `F = C * 1.8 + 32`.

#### 2-fashion-mnist.py
Classification example. Model reads an image and classifies it as one of ten classes. Images are greyscale, 28x28px.

#### 2-fashion-mnist-cnn.py
Classification example with convolution on the images. Training is slower but results are better then in prevoius example.

### Usage
You need python (3.6-3.7) installed and modules: tensorflow, tensorflow_dataset, matplotlib.
